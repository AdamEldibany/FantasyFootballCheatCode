# FantasyFootballCheatCode
This project is aimed at digging deaper into NFL statistics to produce optimal fantasy football results.
The goal of this project is to produce a model that ranks the best players to plan at each position (QB, RB, WR, FLEX, D/ST, K) each week based on a combination of factors including the players' individual performances for the year, their team's current opponent, and more.
